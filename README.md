This repository contains my project dedicated to the assembling genome topic

There are 2 types of files in this repository
1) string_reconstruction files contain only functions and can be regarded as modules
2) genome_reconstruction files use string_reconstruction to reconstruct a string out of the list of k-mers and then give the genome back

Also I have added a solution to a more practical problem of assembling genome from read-pairs
