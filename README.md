This repository contains my project dedicated to the assembling genome topic

There are 2 files in this repository
    1) string_reconstruction contains only functions and can be regarded as
  a library
    2) genome_reconstruction uses string_reconstruction to reconstruct a
  string out of the list of k-mers and then gives the genome back
